# Strapi Location Plugin

**‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è**: NOT Published yet!!

The Strapi Location Plugin is a custom plugin that allows users to create location inputs and store latitude and longitude values as geometry types in a PostGIS database. It also provides functionality to filter items based on their location.

## Caution üñê‚ö†Ô∏è

- This plugin requires a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension enabled (can be used on that database plugin will enable it for you if it can). Make sure you have a compatible database set up before using this plugin. For development I used postgis docker image from here: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/

## Features

- Custom location input field for latitude and longitude values
- Storage of location values as geometry types in a PostGIS database
- Filtering items based on their location
- Searching for items with the same location
- Searching for items within a specified range
